## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about the different propertys for DOM manipulation, and good practices when you need to add and remove elements and styles dynamically.

### Continued development

I want to keep learning so much more of DOM manipulation, and all the great amount of propertys that the elements has, in order to use them to develop an interesting logic for websites, that would be my focus.

### Useful resources

- [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) - This article was very useful to understand a lot better how to manipulate the DOM dynamically
